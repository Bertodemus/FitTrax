## Usage

The site is fairly straightforward. Users can create a `New Workout` or select `Continue Workout`, where they are allowed to input multiple `Exercises` per workout. The exercises can be `Cardio` or `Resistance`. If the user chooses a `Cardio` workout, they will be allowed to track `Exercise Name`, `Distance` travelled (if applicable), and `Duration`. For the `Resistance` exercises, the user will be able to enter in `Exercise Name`, `Weight (lbs)`, `Sets`, `Reps`, and `Duration`. The statistics of the last workout are tallied and presented on the main page. The user can also go to the `Stats` page to see a dashboard of all the workouts and exercises performed over the past week.
